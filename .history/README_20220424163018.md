## __Summary__
This repository aims at sharing the code for paper _Asymmetric spillovers between cryptocurrencies and conventional currencies: the evolution of cross-market connectedness and predictive power_. The whole project has been divided into two section. The first section is for econometric analysis and the corresponding experiment R files are in folder <code>econometric</code>. The second section is for cross-market predictive power examination, the formal python scripts can be found in folder <code>ml</code>. <code>data</code> folder includes all prepared data for this study.

## __Results__
### __Part A__
![img1](img1.png)
__Figure 1: The overall frequency connectedness of the 14 currencies from August 8, 2015 to January 1, 2022.__ The frequency connectedness is measured based on returns (upper left), positive returns (upper right), negative returns (bottom left), and volatility (bottom right), respectively. For each section, the three networks from left to right represent the connectedness matrix within 1 day, 7 days, and 100 days. Red nodes are cryptocurrencies, and blue nodes are conventional currencies. The opacity of nodes is determined by their within-market importance (i.e., within-market subgraph PageRank). The size of nodes indicates their cross-market influence (i.e., cross-market subgraph PageRank). Gray edges are within-market linkages and light purple edges are for cross-market linkages. The width of the edges represents the connectedness level.
