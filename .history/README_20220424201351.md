## __Summary__
This repository aims at sharing the code for paper _Asymmetric spillovers between cryptocurrencies and conventional currencies: the evolution of cross-market connectedness and predictive power_. The whole project has been divided into two section. The first section is for econometric analysis and the corresponding experiment R files are in folder <code>econometric</code>. The second section is for cross-market predictive power examination, the formal python scripts can be found in folder <code>ml</code>. <code>data</code> folder includes all prepared data for this study.

## __Results__
### __Part A__
![img1](img1.png)
__Figure 1: The full-sample frequency connectedness of the 14 currencies from August 8, 2015 to January 1, 2022.__ The frequency connectedness is measured based on returns (upper left), positive returns (upper right), negative returns (bottom left), and volatility (bottom right), respectively. For each section, the three networks from left to right represent the connectedness matrix within 1 day, 7 days, and 100 days. Red nodes are cryptocurrencies, and blue nodes are conventional currencies. The opacity of nodes is determined by their within-market importance (i.e., within-market subgraph PageRank). The size of nodes indicates their cross-market influence (i.e., cross-market subgraph PageRank). Gray edges are within-market linkages and light purple edges are for cross-market linkages. The width of the edges represents the connectedness level.

__Initial conclusion:__ (a) Currencies are mostly connected in short-term; (b) In general, BTC acts as the most active nodes within cryptocurrency market, it interacts actively with altcoins. Meanwhile, it also plays as the biggest cross-market negative information receiver and turbulence receiver. (c) Worthing to note that, although BTC is the most crucial positive spillover transmission node as well, the largest cross-market positive information receiver is actually XRP. 

__Replication:__ Run <code>network analysis.R</code> in <code>econometric</code> folder to reproduce the graph.

__Figure 2: The dynamic frequency connectedness of crypto and conventional currency markets from August 8, 2015 to January 1, 2022.__ The upper left section (i.e., within market section) shows how connectedness within cryptocurrency market and conventional currency market changes during the study period, and the upper right section (i.e., cross market section) shows how connectedness between the two markets evolves during the study period. Both contain 12 (3 rows and 4 columns) subplots. The first to fourth columns in each section, from left to right, represent the return-based, positive return-based, negative return-based, and volatility-based connectedness measurements. The first to third rows correspond to connectedness in different frequency bands (i.e., within one day, within one week, and within 100 days). For the four subplots in the bottom of the figure, they are the dynamic cross-market connectedness without frequency decomposition. Periods with significant Bitcoin price explosivity are shaded in celadon; Pandemic periods are shaded in light red.

__Replication:__ Run <code>dynamic_analysis.R</code> in <code>econometric</code> to reproduce the figure.
