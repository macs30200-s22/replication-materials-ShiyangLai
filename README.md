## __Summary__
This repository aims at sharing the code for paper _Asymmetric spillovers between cryptocurrencies and conventional currencies: the evolution of cross-market connectedness and predictive power_. The whole project has been divided into two section. The first section is for econometric analysis and the corresponding experiment R files are in folder <code>econometric</code>. The second section is for cross-market predictive power examination, the formal python scripts can be found in folder <code>ml</code>. <code>data</code> folder includes all prepared data for this study.

## __Results__
